Step by step for CRM Component Usage to exchange data between two different components.

Scenario: Component A will send data to Component B. PS: Read with attention and do not overpass the steps.

1º) Create Model Node at the Component Controller of the Component B.

        CALL METHOD iv_usage->bind_context_node
          EXPORTING
            iv_controller_type  = cl_bsp_wd_controller=>co_type_component
            iv_target_node_name = 'PARTNER'   "Target Model NODE
            iv_node_2_bind      = 'PARTNER'.  "Actual Model NODE
