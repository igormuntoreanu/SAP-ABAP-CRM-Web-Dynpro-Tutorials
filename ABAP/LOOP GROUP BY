SAP ABAP - Replacement of Loop iteration statements( AT .. ENDAT): 

I have a requirement of summation of net price, quantity and count of materials that are available in the warehouse/plants in different company codes. 

Example:

There are materials like Mat-1,Mat-2,Mat-5,Mat-3 and Mat-4 are available in the plants 200,300 and 400 under the company codes 1010.

Here , the question is the count of the materials are available under plant 200,300 and 400 with respect to the company codes 1010. 

Solution: 

Normally ,if you want to count or sum up the quantities or prices - we will generally use the loop iteration statements like, 

AT FIRST,
AT NEW <Field>,
AT END OF <Field>,
AT LAST.

- If your internal table is in a different structure and you want to use the loop iteration statements it will through the work area filled with with * , to resolve this you have to make another work area and reassign the values and also you donâ€™t need the fields used in combinations to be the first in the table structure.

But in ABAP 7.4+ , we have an alternative approach "GROUP BY" .

Types : Begin of lty_final,
 BUKRS TYPE BUKRS,
 WERKS TYPE WERKS_D,
 MATNR TYPE MATNR_D,
 QTY    TYPE NETWR,
 NETPR TYPE NETWR,
 End of lty_final.

DATA : LT_FINAL TYPE TABLE OF LTY_FINAL.

LOOP AT LT_FINAL INTO DATA(GT_FINAL)
 GROUP BY ( BUKRS = GT_FINAL-BUKRS
 WERKS = GT_FINAL-WERKS
 ).
//This outer loop will group the data w.r.t Burks and plant.

LOOP AT GROUP GT_FINAL ASSIGNING FIELD-SYMBOL(<GFS_FINAL>).

// This inner loop contains only unique company code and plant reading above
//Derivation for material count and other logic.


ENDLOOP.
ENDLOOP.

In GROUP BY there are few additions like size , index in the syntax.

Happy Learning!!
