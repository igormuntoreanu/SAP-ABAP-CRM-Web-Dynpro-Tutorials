*   1. Text collection is a delegated node data where
*      FBI does not support property handling of such a node, so do it
*      manually. If Yard Order/Request in create/edit mode and this object
*      isn't active/released then text collection must be allowed for
*      maintenance.
*   2. It shall not be possible to change an outbound YO item if
*      open tasks with status "Planned", "Active" or "In Process" exist.
*      Note: TU number and loading scheme attributes are still available for input
*   3. check if TU master data properties can be changed:
*     3.1 The TU doesnâ€™t have any SR activities, in other words the
*         TU has never been checked-in yet;
*     3.2 The TU has only one reference to a yard document;
*         it might be either a yard request or a yard order.
