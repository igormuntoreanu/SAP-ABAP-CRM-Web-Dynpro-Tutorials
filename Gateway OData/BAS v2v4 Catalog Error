If you are getting an error due to V4 then register the Catalogs in transaction /IWFND/V4_ADMIN
If you are getting an error for V2 and having the issue in /IWFND/ERROR_LOG:

Property 'UpdatedDate' has invalid value '0 ' 
The expand option's expand path contains an invalid property 'RecommendedServices'
/sap/opu/odata/IWFND/CATALOGSERVICE;v=2/RecommendedServiceCollection


then:

Fix the fields CREATED_TIMESTMP and CHANGED_TIMESTMP in table /IWFND/I_MED_SRH. Adjust the data, it must have a real timestamp and not '0' .
